# Chroot Connection

The inventory now uses Ansible's built-in `chroot` connection plugin:

```yaml
chroot:
  hosts:
    chroot_target:
      ansible_connection: chroot
      ansible_chroot: /mnt
```

This automatically handles running commands in the chroot environment without needing custom scripts or connection plugins.

The `setup-chroot` role only needs to mount the required filesystems - Ansible handles the rest.
